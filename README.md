# WHAT-TO-WEAR

A clothing app prototype developed in Android Studio as a group project for the "Developing Mobile Applications" course at KTH.
The prototype uses Java objects to store a local user database as well as a clothes database for each individual user.

This prototype received an excellent (A) grade for the course.
If you liked the idea and the prototype of the app and believe it can be marketed don't hesitate to contact the contributors.
